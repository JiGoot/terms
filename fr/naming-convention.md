# Supplier Naming Convention
*Last updated*: January 3rd, 2024
</br>
</br>
*<p align="center">This policy aims to strike a balance between legal compliance, customer satisfaction, and efficient business operations. It is essential for restaurants to understand and adhere to these guidelines to maintain a positive and legally sound presence on JiGoot.</p>*
*<p align="center">This policy aims to ensure clarity, uniqueness, and legal compliance in the naming of restaurants listed on JiGoot, our food delivery platform. It outlines the criteria for restaurant names, taking into consideration legal aspects, geographical locations, and potential trademark issues.</p>*

#### 1. Uniqueness within a City:
To avoid customer confusion, JiGoot enforces a policy requiring each restaurant's name (referred to as `supplier.name`) to be unique within the same city. This uniqueness is enforced through the implementation of a unique constraint named `[supplier-unique-name]`.

#### 2. Legal Responsibility:
JiGoot does not hold responsibility for suppliers registering with a name that may be protected under local legislation, trademarks, or existing business registrations. It is the responsibility of the supplier to ensure that their chosen name complies with all legal requirements.

#### 3. Trademarked Names:
If a restaurant's name is trademarked or registered, it may be protected from use by other restaurants without permission or licensing. JiGoot recommends suppliers to check the status of their name with relevant trademark agencies, such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) or the International Trademark Association (ITMA).

#### 4. Geographical Considerations:
To minimize potential conflicts, restaurants in different cities, states, or countries are generally allowed to use the same name. However, if located in the same area, restaurants may need to differentiate themselves by adding a suffix or prefix to their name.

#### 5. Compliance with OHADA Uniform Act:
For restaurants in OHADA member states, the company name must be different from any other existing company name registered in the Trade and Personal Property Credit Register (RCCM). Additionally, it must not be misleading or infringe on any trademark or trade name rights of third parties.

#### 6. Enforcement and Dispute Resolution:
JiGoot reserves the right to enforce the naming policy and may require restaurants to change their name if it violates the established guidelines. In the event of a legal dispute where a registered business wins, JiGoot will support the protection of brand names and reputations by requiring the listed supplier to change their name.

#### 7. Changes to Company Names:
Any changes to a restaurant's name must be communicated to JiGoot, published, and registered as required by local regulations.

#### 8. Terms and Conditions:
All restaurants listed on JiGoot must adhere to these naming conventions as part of the platform's terms and conditions.
